# 🌸 Hey there, I’m so glad you’re here!

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!

I’m currently pursuing my **M.Tech at IIT Guwahati**, specializing in **Fluid and Thermal Engineering**.  
I'm passionate about advancing my technical skills, exploring real-world engineering challenges, and making the learning journey more manageable and enjoyable.

Here, you'll find:

- 🛠️ Projects I’m building or contributing to  
- 📚 Insights from juggling research, deadlines, and debugging  
- 🌱 Inspiring and empowering those navigating the ups and downs of their career — to not only survive but truly thrive.  

Let’s connect, learn, and grow together—one repo at a time.
